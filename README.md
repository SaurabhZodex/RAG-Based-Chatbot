# RAG-Based Chatbot using Simple and Advanced RAG Pipeline

This repository contains two implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using LangChain:

1. **Simple RAG Pipeline**: A basic implementation of a RAG pipeline to demonstrate the core concepts of retrieval-augmented generation.
2. **Advanced RAG Pipeline**: This is an enhanced version of the RAG pipeline with practical tips and tricks to improve retrieval, generation, and overall performance. This is demonstrated by a useful example of building a chatbot to assist with a large amount of data.

## Overview

### Simple RAG Pipeline
This pipeline demonstrates the basic components of a RAG system:
- **Retrieval**: Fetching relevant documents or information from a knowledge base.
- **Generation**: Using a language model to generate responses based on the retrieved information.

### Advanced RAG Pipeline
This pipeline builds on the simple RAG pipeline and introduces advanced techniques to improve:
- **Retrieval Quality**: Better document retrieval using advanced indexing, filtering, and ranking.
- **Generation Quality**: Enhanced response generation with fine-tuned models, context-aware prompts, and post-processing.
- **Practical Application**: A chatbot designed to assist or emulate a human, showcasing how RAG can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Features

### Simple RAG Pipeline
- Basic document retrieval using a vector store.
- Response generation using a pre-trained language model.
- Easy-to-understand implementation for beginners.

### Advanced RAG Pipeline
- Improved retrieval using hybrid search (keyword + semantic).
- Context-aware generation with dynamic prompt engineering.
- Post-processing techniques to refine responses.
